## Introduction:
Food Diary is a very useful app for people who love to cook and try out new recipes.
The app ensures that our users can save their recipes and get free from the hesitation of
forgetting recipes or mixing them up and allows the user to experiment with other
user’s dishes. Food Diary makes finding recipes easy by helping you to save your own
recipe & also view other user’s recipes, thus providing a user-friendly experience.
People find it hard to get new inspiration and are often left clueless on what to cook.
There are certain that were left behind in the past due to change in times, age of
modernity and digitalization many age-old dishes were left simply forgotten. The
application is a complete dynamic system that could showcase the lost traditional
recipes of India to International cuisine by providing an open source to user to share their
recipes.
